		<h3>What an amazing restyling of the website! Now is even more difficult to read than before, but I like the idea of green jungle Vietnam... btw...<br><br>Vietnam is rapidly catching up Thailand as tourists best destination in South East Asia. It is the cheapest country among its peers, with more than decent hostels at 2.5&euro; a night. I am here during the explosion of Coronavirus around the world, and Vietnam borders with China on the North: encouraging. <br> Differently than Thailand, the history of Vietnam is much more troubled and tormented. It was often occupied by the Chineese for thousands of years, before becoming a single state in the XIX century. But it lost its independence right after, falling entirely under France. The French invasion was very humiliating for the Vietnamese, but it left a precious heritage in terms of architecture, infrastructure (railways and swamp reclaim... hanno fatto anche cose buone!!1!1!) and, most importantly, alphabet: in the Vietnamese language there are not idiograms but latin letters, so it may be an easier exotic leanguage to learn, if you are into exotic languages. The infamous Vietnam War (1955-1975) left a permanent scar in Vietnam population and its memory. 45 years after the American occupation (visiting this country is like taking part to a class of history), Vietnam is nowadays a vibrant and fast growing country with 90 million people rapidly improving their standard of life, and the future appears bright. It is a communist country, but does not sympathise very much with China. It has a very strong coffee culture being the second producer in the world after Brazil. Traffic is insane and fascinating at the same time. I start my journey from the South and climb up to the North.

		<h1> HO CHI MINH CITY - SAIGON </h1>
		<h2> <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh" target="_blank">Ho Chi Minh</a> (1890-1969) was the communist leader who fought for the indipenence of Vietnam against the French occupation during the Indochina War (1946-1954), the Japanese occupation during the WWII and the Americans. He is the pragmatic, charismatic and patriottic father of the nation. Saigon was the capital of the South Vietnam, influenced by Americans during the war. In 1975 the communist entered the government palace (reunification palace) and won the war. Saigon was renamed "Ho Chi Minh City" in honor of his leader. Today HCMC has 7.4mln people, the most populated city of Vietnam. It is a fashinating mix of skyscrapers and French colonial architecture. It is a city that has a lot to offer, traffic included.</h2>

 				<p>The Riunification Palace, former Independence Palace, was the headquarter of the government of South Vietnam, suppored by USA in the fight against the expansion of communism in Asia. The war operations and intelligence were conducted in the bunkers underground the palace, which are very interesting to visit. It was also the residence of top-officials Saigon government. There are many big cerimonial halls used to host international diplomats and officials, especially from America, Austalia, New Zeland, the "Western" countries partecipating in the war. It is a very nice and massive '60s style architecture palace in Saigon. In 1975, the tanks of the Nord-Vietnam NLF (National Liberation Front aka Viet Cong, VC) braking the fence simbolized the end of the war, the victory of the communists and the unification of a independent Vietnam. Saigon became HCMC.</p>

 				<p>The citycenter of Saigon is very nice. There are a lot of colorful coffe shops, restaurants, smoothies bar, shiny glass skyscapers... It is very colorful and green, thanks to the tree-lined avenues running through the citycenter (a French heritage). This was my favourite place. It is a pedestrian street full of little book stores on both side. New or used, English or Vietnamese, old or recent, books or notebooks, you can find what you are looking for. There is a quiet and cozy athosphere so you can seat in the big open coffee shop reading or working on your laptop. At the end of the street, you find the most famous French architectures of the city: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_Cathedral_Basilica_of_Saigon" target="_blank">Notre-Dame de <span class="barrato">Paris</span> Saigon</a>, with two 40m square plant towers in the facade, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigon_Central_Post_Office" target="_blank">Central Post Office</a>, designed by Gustave Eiffel in 1886, which is both a touristic attraction and an actual Post Office.</p>

 				<p>These were incredible. When you enemy is the most technologial advanced country in the world and you can rely only on bamboo sticks, you need to make do. Cu Chi Tunnels is a system of 250km of undergound tunnels at up to 20m depth outside Saigon, digged BY HAND or with basic tools. They were used to protect against massive bombing or napalm outside, and to organize sudden attaks in the night. VC were living here even for weeks. Complete darkness (candels burn oxigen, and artifical light was too expensive), narrow and low (VC were little guys, while for Americans was more difficult to access. Crawling inside was already difficult and painful for me that I just had a tshirt, imagine with the army uniform and weapons), no air (even though an incredible ventilation system was set up). Little clautrophoibic ah? There were even kitches, warehouses, curel Saw-style traps for who went inside without knowing the settings of the path. Wow. </p>

 			</div>
 			<div class="commento">
 				<p>The most typical thing in Saigon: traffic. There are no rules. The driving code is turned into fluid-dynamics laws: just go, stopping is even more dangerous than throw youself into the mob. You are a drop inside a river, so go with the flow. 7 million people, NO SUBWAY (they have no money for it), owning a car is prohibitive (imported cars are subjected to tariffs which turn the price 3x the actual cost). There are therefore around 7 million motorbikes invading the streets. There is an advantage though: the traffic never stops! Is very quick to move around. No traffic lights, you never end up bottled hours in traffic jam like in Bangkok. No space in the street? Just go on the sidewalk, no problem. Everyone is scared about buses, since the bigger has the precedence (they do not have problem to read-end and smash you on the asphalt). Reassuring. </p>

 			<div class="commento">
 				<p>War Remnants Museum is the best museum of the city that wants to testify the brutality of war. It is interesting because it takes the point of view of Vietnam, even though America has always been quite transparent and honest in retrospect about its mistakes, so there were not big scoops. Robert McNamara, hawkish US Defence Secretary at that time, confessed "Yet we were wrong, terribly wrong. We owe it to future generations to explain why". Public opinion in America has always been terribly skeptical about this war (e.g. Hippy movement - 1969 Woodstock concert...). One of the most impressive cruelty was the use of Agent Orange, a chemical weapon used by Americans on 25% of Vietnamese territory for deforestation. Beside damaging the fertility of the turf for years, it created genetic problem among the population. Even the following generation of Vietnamese was directly affected by the war: many people were born with incredible phisical deformations. Monsters who could not make anything in their miserable existance in a poor devastated country. But still, Vietnamese had the strenght to move on, without any resentment against US for what happened.  </p>

 				<p>Come back to something more cheerful. This is the almost-top of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbn2q6bZZG8" target="_blank"></a>Landmark81, the tallest skyscrapers in South East Asia, and 17th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings" target="_blank">tallest building in the world</a>. I love skyscrapers, so I must go inside the tallest everytime I visit a country. Best tip: avoid the skydecks/terraces/obervatories. They are a very expensive way to go on the top of towers. Do instead a little of research and look for a lounge of a fancy hotel inside. You may sacrify a few floors, but the entrance is free. You just need to pay for a drink. Cheaper, same effect and you also have a drink to enjoy the panorama.</p>

		<h1> DALAT</h1>
		<h2> Heading North, <a href="" target="_blank">Dalat</a>, 400k people, is one of the most popular touristic destination in VN. It is a city situated in a plateau 1500m above sea level, so it was used by the French, and still used nowadays, as a vacation site for escaping the humidity of the South tropical climate. French-style vaction villas are preserved since Dalat was fortunatelly spared by the Vietnam war. On the side of the steep and curvy streets characterizing a montane city, there are tons of bars, restaurants, neon lights, and beautiful hotels. But the best to see are the natural surroundings. </h2>

 				<p>Rent a scooter for 5&euro; a day and stroll around the city. You will see many paddies (risaie), strawberry fields (forever), coffee and peppers plantations. Wine from Dalat is very famous in Vietnam. If you are hungry, stop in one of the villages around and eat in the houses of locals. I was expecting to eat something typical and local, but unfortunaly they had to offer just instant noodles. Like in the village is like our grandparents'. Little pretty kids catching innocent hens and nonchalantly tied them upside-down, put 'em in a platic bag, and sell 'em to pretty ganny. If you have empty cans or platic bottles, just throw them in the backyard. Here I realized that taking care of the environment is a mindset reserved for the "riches". People from the village of Vietnam couldn't care less about climate change, and this is understandable (like us at the end...). </p>

 				<p>Hang Nga is the daughter of the president of Vietnam in the 1980s, who was the number two communist leader after HCM. So we are talking about VN élite. She graduated in architecture in Moscow. She built and owns this amazing house, the Crazy House. It reminds of course Gaudì houses in Barcelona. It is very big, there are stairs, ramps, terraces, narrow bridges, plants, trees twisting among each other. It is also a guesthouse, so you can rent very nice rooms for the night. If you manage to find them once you come back in the night, you can even sleep in them. It is like to be in a house from fairytales or from the Lord of Rings. It is one of the most extravagant things I ve ever seen until then, but, on the same day in the night, I saw something even more astonishing and disturbing: the Maze Bar. </p>

 			</div>
 			<div class="commento">
 				<p>This was insane. It is a bar in the center of Dalat built from the same architecture of the Crazy House. Same concept: a labirinth. Calling it "labirinth" is not an exageration. It is actually huge! More or less 5 floors (you do not really have specific "floors", since everything is tangled inside the external structure). While walking, you always find new alleys, doors, stairs, small ramps. Sometime is even dangerous because there are big holes on the pavement which heads you to the room below you. Same Tolkien athmosphere of the Crazy House, but in the dark. Get a drink and the entrance, and good luck! You can hear the music distantly from the rooftop where most people stay, but you often find yourself in dark and completely isolated corners, with creepy faces hanging out from the wooden wallsQ2Q. You may end up finding some drunk creatures who got lost in the bar months before when they were still a humans. </p>

 				<p>There are many waterfalls around the city. Pongour Falls are 2 hours by scooter from Dalat. They offer a better show during the rainy season when water is abundant. But they were still very nice. A group of nice Vietnamese invited me to their picnic there. They do not speak a word of English, but they are happy to meet Westerns to take selfies, offering beers and chicken feet. </p>
