		<h3>What an amazing restyling of the website! Now is even more difficult to read than before, but I like the idea of green jungle Vietnam... btw...<br><br>Vietnam is rapidly catching up Thailand as tourists best destination in South East Asia. It is the cheapest country among its peers, with more than decent hostels at 2.5&euro; a night. I am here during the explosion of Coronavirus around the world, and Vietnam borders with China on the North: encouraging. <br> Differently than Thailand, the history of Vietnam is much more troubled and tormented. It was often occupied by the Chineese for thousands of years, before becoming a single state in the XIX century. But it lost its independence right after, falling entirely under France. The French invasion was very humiliating for the Vietnamese, but it left a precious heritage in terms of architecture, infrastructure (railways and swamp reclaim... hanno fatto anche cose buone!!1!1!) and, most importantly, alphabet: in the Vietnamese language there are not idiograms but latin letters, so it may be an easier exotic leanguage to learn, if you are into exotic languages. The infamous Vietnam War (1955-1975) left a permanent scar in Vietnam population and its memory. 45 years after the American occupation (visiting this country is like taking part to a class of history), Vietnam is nowadays a vibrant and fast growing country with 90 million people rapidly improving their standard of life, and the future appears bright. It is a communist country, but does not sympathise very much with China. It has a very strong coffee culture being the second producer in the world after Brazil. Traffic is insane and fascinating at the same time. I start my journey from the South and climb up to the North.

		<h1> HO CHI MINH CITY - SAIGON </h1>
		<h2> <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh" target="_blank">Ho Chi Minh</a> (1890-1969) was the communist leader who fought for the indipenence of Vietnam against the French occupation during the Indochina War (1946-1954), the Japanese occupation during the WWII and the Americans. He is the pragmatic, charismatic and patriottic father of the nation. Saigon was the capital of the South Vietnam, influenced by Americans during the war. In 1975 the communist entered the government palace (reunification palace) and won the war. Saigon was renamed "Ho Chi Minh City" in honor of his leader. Today HCMC has 7.4mln people, the most populated city of Vietnam. It is a fashinating mix of skyscrapers and French colonial architecture. It is a city that has a lot to offer, traffic included.</h2>

 				<p>The Riunification Palace, former Independence Palace, was the headquarter of the government of South Vietnam, suppored by USA in the fight against the expansion of communism in Asia. The war operations and intelligence were conducted in the bunkers underground the palace, which are very interesting to visit. It was also the residence of top-officials Saigon government. There are many big cerimonial halls used to host international diplomats and officials, especially from America, Austalia, New Zeland, the "Western" countries partecipating in the war. It is a very nice and massive '60s style architecture palace in Saigon. In 1975, the tanks of the Nord-Vietnam NLF (National Liberation Front aka Viet Cong, VC) braking the fence simbolized the end of the war, the victory of the communists and the unification of a independent Vietnam. Saigon became HCMC.</p>

 				<p>The citycenter of Saigon is very nice. There are a lot of colorful coffe shops, restaurants, smoothies bar, shiny glass skyscapers... It is very colorful and green, thanks to the tree-lined avenues running through the citycenter (a French heritage). This was my favourite place. It is a pedestrian street full of little book stores on both side. New or used, English or Vietnamese, old or recent, books or notebooks, you can find what you are looking for. There is a quiet and cozy athosphere so you can seat in the big open coffee shop reading or working on your laptop. At the end of the street, you find the most famous French architectures of the city: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_Cathedral_Basilica_of_Saigon" target="_blank">Notre-Dame de <span class="barrato">Paris</span> Saigon</a>, with two 40m square plant towers in the facade, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigon_Central_Post_Office" target="_blank">Central Post Office</a>, designed by Gustave Eiffel in 1886, which is both a touristic attraction and an actual Post Office.</p>

 				<p>These were incredible. When you enemy is the most technologial advanced country in the world and you can rely only on bamboo sticks, you need to make do. Cu Chi Tunnels is a system of 250km of undergound tunnels at up to 20m depth outside Saigon, digged BY HAND or with basic tools. They were used to protect against massive bombing or napalm outside, and to organize sudden attaks in the night. VC were living here even for weeks. Complete darkness (candels burn oxigen, and artifical light was too expensive), narrow and low (VC were little guys, while for Americans was more difficult to access. Crawling inside was already difficult and painful for me that I just had a tshirt, imagine with the army uniform and weapons), no air (even though an incredible ventilation system was set up). Little clautrophoibic ah? There were even kitches, warehouses, curel Saw-style traps for who went inside without knowing the settings of the path. Wow. </p>

 			<div class="commento">
 				<p>The most typical thing in Saigon: traffic. There are no rules. The driving code is turned into fluid-dynamics laws: just go, stopping is even more dangerous than throw youself into the mob. You are a drop inside a river, so go with the flow. 7 million people, NO SUBWAY (they have no money for it), owning a car is prohibitive (imported cars are subjected to tariffs which turn the price 3x the actual cost). There are therefore around 7 million motorbikes invading the streets. There is an advantage though: the traffic never stops! Is very quick to move around. No traffic lights, you never end up bottled hours in traffic jam like in Bangkok. No space in the street? Just go on the sidewalk, no problem. Everyone is scared about buses, since the bigger has the precedence (they do not have problem to read-end and smash you on the asphalt). Reassuring. </p>
