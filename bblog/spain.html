		<h3> My trip started in South West Spain, the Andalusia region, home of woderful cities such as Sevilla, Malaga, Granada, Cordoba... I chose this destination because of: the warm climate (the latitude is the same as Sicily), it is in Europe (no problem with money exchange and visa), relatively cheap, nice people, and the best thing you can do in life: tapa y cerveza.</h3>

Then, should be visited after you came to Barca or Valencia, which have more to show. But Malaga is an awesome city to live for a period. Is much less chaotic/dirty then Barcelona, less stressful and is sunny 350 days per day (the walking tour guy said). Is the city of Picasso and Antonio Banderas. The citycenter is lovely, and it has a big airport at 20 minutes by bus for the citycenter. I stayed here the first 1 week in a very nice rooptop hostel. (Google Chome cannot open the cover image of Malaga idk why)</h2>

A cool thing about this beach is that, instead of gery pigeones, there are funny green birds that contributes to the hexotic athmosphere together with the palm trees. There are a lot of bars along the beach, and in the background you can see the Alcazaba.</p>

Malaga's Alcazaba is like a small Alhambra, with little Arab-style gardens, patios and rooms. From the top you have a nice view of the city and of the sea (which Alhambra hasn't).</p>

 				<p>This is the Malaga cathedral. Is very big, and you can notice there were supposed to be 2 towers, but there is one only. For this reason is dubbed "La Manquita" (the arm-less, quite gross). A very typical Spanish issue that you hear in every city you go, is that there are always huge hystorical monuments which were clearly left incoplete beacuse they run out of money. Here you have an example. In the past they found the money to finish it, but Malaguenos were already very attached to their Manquita, so it remained as it is. </p>

While the mayor masterpiece are stored elsewere (Guernica is at the Reina Sofia in Madrid, and the "Les demoiselles d'Avignon" is at the Moma in Nyc), there are nice painings. Jacqueline Sentada was my favourite, where Picasso's muse and second wife <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Roque">Jacqueline Roque</a> is potrayed</p>

Before its rennovation in 2015, it was the destinatio for many adventurous climbers. After the death of 5 people, they decided to build a safe walkaway and open it to the public.</p>

Here you see a video to get the athmosphere during this week and how much Spanish people like to party. Here <em>eveyone</em> can dance really good, and the reason is explained in the second video. It was 5 in the morning, I was of course very tired and I wanted to go home, but I stopped looking these little girls still dancing like crazy. Now you understand.</p>

 			<p>The reason why you should visit Granada: the Alhambra. Is a massive fortress which dominates the city. Was the residence of the sultan during the 700 years arabic occupation (711-1492dc). Nowadays represent 95% of Granada GDP (Im exaggerating), thanks to the tourists coming from all over the world to see it. Is the second most-visited monument in Spain after the Sagrada Familia. In the background, the Sierra Nevada, the highest mountain in continental Spain (the highest in in the Caray Islands). On winter, with the snow, the view should be very spectacular. Book the tickets weeks in advance OR at midnight sharp of the same day on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alhambra-patronato.es">ufficial website</a>.

 			<p>Inside, the Alhambra is composed by 4 main spots: the Alcazaba (miliary fortress), the Palace of Charles V, Generalife and the Nasrid Palaces. Generalife (pronounced "hhhhh eneral y fe", and not insurance-company-style-name "general life"), was the summer residence of the sultant (200m from home and not on the beach... what a holiday!). The gardens are very beaufitul, with waterways, foundains, flowers... You can distinuish this part from the rest of the Alhambra for its pure white color, in contrast with the red-brick of the fortress. </p>

 				<p>The Nasard Palaces were the actual residence of the sultan. Is a complex of many precious palaces with amazing arab decorations. Just imagine how long did it take to carve all the decoration of huge walls and rooftop. There is a magic Alladin athosphere inside the rooms, with the soft-light of the bright sun of Granda coming through the dark windows. The Nasrids were the last arabic dynasty occupying Spain until the <em>Reconquista</em> by the Catholic Kings Isabel I of Castille and Ferdinand II of Aragon in 1492. The Nasrids started building the Alhambra in 1232 to impress visitors and celebrate the muslim power in the rest of the world.</p>

A labirinth of white narrow street that climbs on the hill of Sacromonte.

Is a place where to get lost and explore, until you find one of the many "Miradores" from where you get a view of the entire city from the top, and of course a view of the Alhambra (very nice/romantic in the night). There are a lot of street artist around playing flamenco, and a considerable amount of hippies consuming a considerable amout of recreational essence.</p>

People were even asking me if I were from Granada after my amazing explanation of the of the origin of the name Granada (means pomegranate because there are pomegrates here... wohoo!). For the question that you do not know, you can say whatever BS you want: noone fact-checks, and even if someone does, he/she ask the money back... Cause it is free! Genius. The final part of the tour was the most spectacular: watching the amazing sunset of Granda from the top of Albaicin: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.it/maps/place/Mirador+de+San+Miguel/@37.1857282,-3.5877763,17.52z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x708fff5a5837e574!2sErmita+de+San+Miguel+Alto!8m2!3d37.1848957!4d-3.58767!3m4!1s0x0:0xe7182c419edae537!8m2!3d37.1847142!4d-3.587877">el Mirador de San Miguel</a>.

Here I met people mainly from US, Australia, Canada, New Zeland, Israel, UK, France, Germany. This is a scene from lunchtime, when everyone is visitng the city and I had time for learn coding.

 				<p>Another <strong>awesome and very profitable</strong> way to finance you trip is to go to play on the street with your colleague Leonardo and <em>Luciano Di Pasquale</em>, the Argentinian guy who introduced me to HTML (juventus T-shirt). We did it only one day, and Luciano was free-styling on Leonardo's guitar reefs. Rap on a ballad, the new fronteer of music. We receive the first money (the starting money in the guitar-case were our coins) after I started to play Ed Sheeran and a couple of old ladies came to me asking the title of the song (Photograph). In the meanwhie, the other 2 guys were playing football on the square. We earned <strong>80 cents</strong> that day, to be split in 3, even if I claimed a bigger 50% share for my success.</p>

It is really stunning. <em>Seems like you are inside a kaleidoscope</em>. I suggest to go early in the morning as soon as it open because is free, and, most important, you manage to take a picture without people (10 seconds after I took this picture it was already crowded).

 				<p>Las "Setas de Sevilla", or "Metropol Parasol" or "Mushroom" ("Seta" means "mushroom" in Spanish), is a controversial structure built in 2011 by German architect Jurgen Mayer. Does't seem like, but is make of wood. And it is the biggest wooden structure in the world (26 meters heigh). You can go up to have a beautiful view of Sevile from the walkway going through the hollow roof. Many people considered it ugly, and maybe it is. Moreover, it was super expentive (50 mln Euro projected, actual costs 100millions Euro... But still better than 7bln Euro useless Venice Mose). But I find it fasinating. </p>
