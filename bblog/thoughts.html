		<h3> Here I will put some randoom thoughts that come up in my mind, and sharing some ideas about my trip! </h3>
	</div>

	<div class="description">
		<h4> ...to start: why am I doing this trip? </h4>
		<p>Answer: to find myself... whatever that means... (what does it mean actually?). <br>
		I would start to explain you what I am escaping from, which can be well-summarized by this video: </p>

		<div class="fianco">
			<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9dZQelULDk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p class="lato">I found this video very inspirational (I hate the word <em>inspiring</em>... it reminds me the posts on Linkedin. I think going on linkedin is a real torture: all this suit and tie guys who do all "very inspiring" thing... bah... lucky them!). <br>
			Anyway, I saw myself as the mouse in the video while I was taking morning the subway in Milan to get to work, and looking at all the walking dead starring at their phone (I was one of them). I was not happy at all.</p>
		</div>

		<p>Add this unhappiness to my way of reasoning typical of an engineer: maximise utility subject to limited resources: aka: enjoy you life as much as possible because the existance on this earth is unique, and time is quite a precious and limited resource, at it doesn't wait for you.<br></p>

		<p>How many times did you tell youself "is not the right moment, I will do it later when I will be richer/have more time... Well. I am 26, I did my duties, I dont have any kind of resonsability such as a family, bills to pay, mortgages... (I consider myself very lucky form this point of view).<br></p>

		<p>Here I am then! Is been sice August that I am travelling around Spain to learn a new language (another "productive time" initiaive).<br></p>

		<h4> The recepit </h4>
		<p>Let's go though some of these pros and cons. You can contact me if you want to talk about/add something. Hope you will found it <em>inspiring</em>.</p>

		<p><br><span class="punto">Cons1)</span> Money. Plata. Il cash. (<em>Grazie a graziella e grazie al signor C</em>). How to do it? <br>
		Here are the main CONCERETE strategies:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Long-term travelling is cheaper than you think: you need to spend on 3 things: ACCOMODATION, FOOD, TRANSPORATION. Full stop. If you don't have much savings apart: forget eating outside, forget cocktails at the bars, forget new clothes (you don't need new shoes/tie/frac for the office and you can take out again your hippy clothes form high school), forget sushi. Which is fine! I forgot how cheap and healthy is to cook at home. When I was working was like: too tired to cook, get a pizza (min &euro;5), get a readymade-sandich (min &euro;4). A cheap gintonic costs &euro;3.5 (<a href="https://www.tripadvisor.it/Restaurant_Review-g187849-d4424572-Reviews-Caffe_Picchio-Milan_Lombardy.html" target="_blank">Marchetta al miglior bar di Milano<a>). At the end, you end up spending &euro;20 per day for food. With attention, you can max spend &euro;5 per day. <strong>Clothes expences: &euro;0</strong>. You don't have space in the backpack for new thinks (how much you spend per month in shopping?). </li>
			<li>MOST IMPORTANT: accomodation. Answer: <a href="https://www.worldpackers.com" target="_blank">Worlpackers</a> (or Workaway). Is called work-exchange. You go to hostels, houses, camps in the mountains helping out with some activities (cleaning, reception, bar,...plant bananas if you like them, and I know you like them), and in exchnage they give you a place to sleep, a kitchen for cook your food (see previous point), a washing machine. <strong>Cost for accomodation: &euro;0</strong>. Sometime you also manage to eat for free (food problem solved). Well, of couse you have to WORK, but: is a fun job, that allows you to interract with many different people. And on averge you work 30h per week (amazing tip: go to work in hostel in low-season. I am right now in Cadiz, which is a sea-city, and it's november. I work 12h per week). So you have still A LOT OF FREE TIME. </li>
			<li>
				TRAVELLING: you have the big advnatage that you are FLEXIBLE. Forget asking for vacation to your boss on mid-august. You can decide so much in advance, and pay very few bucks for the airplane (remember that you have just a hand-luggage). For example, I manage to go to NYC round trip for &euro;270 (don't go to nyc if you are on a budget). Or use blablacar. Travelling within Europe is cheap, and you do not need Visa (<strong>God Bless European Union</strong>). If you are travelling in exotic places like Asia or South America, living is cheap, and your long-distance flightcan be a little compensated by the cost of living. Anyway, you would spend around 1 month in a city, so travelling expences do not happen that often. You can spend a lifetime between Spain and Portugal. If you optimize and plan your trip you do not even have to take a plane. Ah! You do not need to spend money for the monthly ticket of your city-transportation. 
				Note: imagine that, after months of working hard, is time for your well deserved holiday: 10 days in Dubai: let's make it cheap: (flight 500&euro; hotel 10*50=500&euro; food 30*10=300&euro; others: 200&euro; =tot 1500&euro;).
				<strong class="principle">Priciple: 1&euro; as backpackers is worth more than 1&euro; as normal worker</strong>. Put that into your mind. With 1500â‚¬ you can compfortable travelling for 3months, with A LOT OF FREE TIME.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p><br><span class="punto">Pros6)</span> It means: if you are canalized in your routine, surrounded by similar people than you, the game is kinda done. Of course, you may have a promotion, have a successful idea, everything can happen. But the likelyhood of breakthough episodes are very unlikely (see the mouse video). For what it worth, I started coding cause I met this guy from Argentina in my hostel (a very Argentinia name: Luciano di Pasquale) which works online, never went to the university, and code for a heathcare startup. Amazing! I asked him if could give me an introdcory lesson on how to make a website, and here I am! If you work from Monday to Friday, you do not want to come back home at 9pm and start to learn how to code. Or, at least, I cannot</p>

		<p><br><span class="punto">Pros9)</span> It is serious. Here is the point. If you did a marketing class, you heard something like "we do not sell a prodcut, we sell experience". See Starbucks for example. We are a generation who did not miss anything material. We ALL have cars, phones, etc... If you need to satisfy your need to feel cool with the others, having the iPhoneX or the BMW is not a big deal anymore, as it would have been for our parents for example. We want experience, we do not want stuff. We have differt means as well: make a nice selfie duck-faced and put it on instagram for example. 2000 likes are worth more than an iPhoneX for our ego. Or, my favourite: instagram stories! You can show others that your life at this moment is quite cool (then, hapiness in another thing). An instagram story on the beach with "sunset lover" in the background costs less than a BMW</p>

		<p><br><span class="punto">Cons2)</span>Relax, nothing is under control. I knew people who did not study at all at the university and graduated with bad grades, and are not even smart as the usual story may suggest, who have better jobs that the ones who work their ass off. Relax, nothing is under control. Do you best, but do not do it only for the money/prestige. It is very risky! What if it does not go how you expect? It is a pitty to think back how much time/effort you put for nothing.</p>

		<p><br><span class="punto">Cons6)</span>How does it look like a hole of 3months/6months/12months on your CV? What the recriuters will think about it? Solution: with the right words, you can twist reality as you wish. One issue would be: why should I reward you that you were on holiday, and not a serious guy who worked 10 hours per day right after university in a serious company? In my opinion they should't. But I noticed that hard-competences are usually not rewarded as they should. Big corporation are filled with slogan "we need open-minded people, we want problem solvers, we want leaders"... it doesnt mean anything. That hole on your CV lays the foundation for building a great story full of nice words and nice BS, and who knows... <span> class="punto">Cons2)</span> If you manage to get in, you are back in the race of normality (well, you would be a junior while your university friends are aready managers. But you had an awesome time and you have a lifetime to "catch up". </p>

		<p><br><span class="punto">Pros2) Cons9)</span>You can also work out a strategy to mitigate the risks coming from cons 6-2-3-4). You are gonna have so much time for yourself and do what you like. Fall in the spiral party-wake up at noon every day-watch netflix-eat-party can be very tempting, and increase the probability that 6-2-3-4 will materialize. The solution is to focus on something that you like and you can resell on the job market later. So: build a routine anyway, buy a grammar book for the language you are learning, learn how to code, study something that you like, make a Standford on-line classes on statistics/marketing/whatever... All things that maybe you cannot focus on while you are working full time. after 6months of vacation you can put on your CV: "languages spoken: +1" or "programming languages: SQL proficiency, or basic HTML CSS Javascript Python..." or "Standfor statistic and econometric course". Pretty cool! So, keep on going even thought you are on holday. Moreover, being 6m doing nothing I think is a miserable way of living, and all the porpuse of the trip fall down</p>

		<p><br><span class="punto">Cons10)</span>I did not find the solution yet. But if I managed to find a job online, I will let you know. </p>

<div class="description">
		<h4> What if we are all do it? Rethinking capitalism in the IT era</h4>
		<p>Quite provicative and exaggerated. But just some thoughts. <br> In the western world, we live in a oversupplied society. We do not have scarcity of basic needs. The economy is stagnating since 2008 because of the financial crisis, but also because of a lack of aggregate demand "aka, we dont need other cars, houses... aka oversupply "you find all kind of variety of products in the supermarket, ikea is filled with cheap fornitures, the car sector is in crisis cause there is not enough demand...". Add the fact that pushing for further hyperconsuminsm to increase the demand is not a good idea in a planet that is getting destroyed by humans. The problem is that wealth is not distributed, so much of this supply (see real estate) is unbalanced toward a few chuck of popuation. The IT and the "sharing economy" can facilitate a more efficient use of the resources which become more stautared. See blablacar, worldpacers, chouchsurfing. What I am saying is that, if you know how to move, you can exploit this oversupply (anyway, you do not buid a family living with wordpackers, so it is easier for solo-traveller). If everyone would do that, ther would be a severe lack of workforce in the corporations and they would be forces to increase the salary to retain their employees from leaving their work. </p>
