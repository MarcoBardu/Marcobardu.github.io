		<h3> I am going through a life period in which I am putting under discussion everything about our society and our way of living. I may sound like a 16-years old Marxist tennager, speaking during a rally in the pep-assembly of his high school. But please, don't take it too seriously. I don't want to sound polemical or denounce the multinationals that are exploiting "el Pueblo proletario" and destroying our planet. Just give you (and me) some pills of thoughts. Moreover, it feels cool to sound like a 16-years old Marxist tennager, so you can think that I am an intellectual. </h3>

		<h4> Macro assumption of our society.</h4>
		<p>Let's start from the biggest picture, considering long-term and high-impact facts/assumption regarding out planet/economy:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Without considering meteors, climate change / pollution / natural resource scarcity is the biggest threat for humankind</li>
			<li>Unrestrained consumerism accelerates point 1) </li>
			<li>Economic growth is based on point 2</li>
			<li>Economic growth is the political target that reconcile all the parties </li>
			<li>We live in a oversupplied world. As an aggregate, we do not miss anything. But inequality is very high.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>SOLUTION: <strong>happy degrowth</strong>. Actually seems like the perfect solution if you are looking our world from a martian perspective in 40 years. Problem: in the short term is impossible to implement, and no-one wants it.
		My solution: <strong>HAPPY STATIC!</strong>. Since been almost a decade that in Italy we are living an "unhappy static" period (negligible GDP growth). It is tough, but is not the armageddon. So, it is just a matter of turning the unhappy into happy (decrease inequality, work less, work all).

		<h4>My case</h4>
		<p>In August I started a roadtrip to find the better strategy to escape from this:</p>

			<p>Who is the mouse?</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It was me, and how my life was turning</li>
				<li>If you are someone ambitiuous who wants to accomplish great things in life, it is probably you</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The general goal of life I think is to maximize happiness. Money helps you accomplish happiness. The problem is when money become the <strong>target</strong>, and not the <strong>mean</strong> to reach a target. I think is worth to live a life such as the one of the mouse only if you then become <strong>very very very rich</strong>. I am talking about hunderds of millions! But it is very difficult and nothing is certain/plannable. The biggest threat: <strong> be stuck in the middle</strong>: that state where you keep on pursuing a career growth, money, prestige, but it doesn't arrive (at least, in a big amount). And this is the most likely scenario of course. There is a 98% probability that on your fifties you realize that life slipped from your hands because you were too busy working hard in the office and get a promotion. (note: if you love you job, everything I said is not valid anymore) </p>
