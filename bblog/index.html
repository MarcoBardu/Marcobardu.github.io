		<h4> ...to start: a little bit of context. </h4>
		<p>Hello! I am Marco, 26 from Italy. I graduated in engineering in 2018 and, after a <span class="barrato">too</span> short period of working, I decided to take some months off for travelling! <br></br>In order to "make my time productive", while donig something that is considered rightly an holiday, I decide to learn how to code. The reasons are two: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Back in real life, When I will be in front of the HRs for getting a serious job, I can say: "Hey! I was chilling for bunch of months, but forgive me! <strong>PLZ!</strong> I can program now!</li>
			<li>I think the best thing someone from my generation can do is to learn a job that allows him/her to work online, and hopefully never come back to an office. You can become very flexible in facing a turbolet job market, and, most important: GEOGRAPHICAL ARBITRAGE! That is: earning in USD and spending in Thai Bath: that is: working for an American client, getting paid decent amount of dollars, and live <strong>LIKE A KING/BOSS</strong> in an exotic place such as Thailand, while you are happly working on a beach on the PhiPhi island.</li>
		</ol>
