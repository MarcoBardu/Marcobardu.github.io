		<h3>Given the proximity of Andalusia to Marocco (and thanks to Ryanair flights), I went to Marrakech for 3 days. To be honest, a little disappointing. Before my departure, some Moroccan friends advised me against going to Marrakech: there are far better places to visit in Marocco. It was true. If you have the opportunity, go to Marrakech for just one day, and then proceed to other cities/the desert (suggestions: Casablanca, Rabat, Fez, Tetuan). But anyway, it is a city that I wanted to see, so there it is:</h3>

 			<p>It was my first time on Afrian soil, and you really can say it is a different world: Marrakech it is messy, and, despite is considered safe, you do not really feel super confortable. It is a very turistic city, so prices are relatively high, and there are people everywhere trying to squeeze money from you, which is a little annoying. <br>Here you have the Koutobia Mosque and its Minaret (77 meters) can be seem from all over Marrakech. It is the biggest religious builidng of the city, landmark of the city. It rises in the main square of Jemaa el-Fna, where plenty of food stands and snake charmer populate the citycenter. Do not dare to put too much attention to the snakes, otherwise they will aggressively ask you for money or, even worse, put the snakes on you. 
 			For food: go to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.it/maps/place/Cafe+Kif-Kif/@31.625317,-7.9943347,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xdafee5cd1fde6fb:0x5f4f2a139e0f578c!8m2!3d31.625317!4d-7.992146">Caf&eacute; Kif-Kif</a>, and get the <a target="_blank" href="https://images.app.goo.gl/211d8pP3gsx2Hf4W6">chicken Tajine with prunes</a>: it was the best chiecken I have ever eaten, and the prunes fit perfeclty. You also have a spectacular view of the Koutobia Tower from the rooftop of the caf&eacute;, especially during night.</p>

 			<p>Alladin-style roofs of Marrakech. The weather is always beautiful in Morocco, and warm. It was the end of November, and there were 23 degrees during the day. A very pleasant weather. On the other hand, the city is quite dirty, with a strong smell of cat pee mixed with leather, smog coming form the many scooter, and spices/food. Very exotic we can say. On the left of the pic, you can see the Minaret of the Koutoubia Mosque.</p>

 				<p>Medina sprawls all over the citycenter of Marrakech. It is a maze of little streets and alleys where thousands of shops sell their goods. I do not know how much "handcraft" there was in all of this, since the different objects and souverins were all the same in all the shops (probably all made in Asia). Moreover, nothing particularly cool to buy. Typical touristic trap. Nice to make a walk around, but I wonder who would buy that many lamps/glasses/plates... I think these merchants are suffering very much from e-commerce and China competition, where you can buy better goods for 3 times less the price they make, without filling your hand luggage and make Ryanain angry. Even here, prepare for annoying sellers (well, <em>annoying</em> is not the right term, since it is part of the game when going to these places).</p>

 			<p><br>El-Badi Palace is a huge ruined palace in the center of Marrakech. It was built in the 16th Century, commissioned by a sultan of the Saadian dynasty (same dynasty of the tombs, see under). After the fall of the dynasty, the following (Alaouite) used the material of the palace to build their own palaces somewhere else. In the middle of the big fountain, there is a squared-platform you access though narrow stepways, so be careful not to fall (what an essential advice for you trip to Morocco).</p>

 				<p>There is one thing that you will love about Marrakech: is it full of cats. Literally everywhere: in the street, inside the bars, restaurants, shops... It is the city with the highest number of cats I ve ever seen. Some are very social, others do not give you much attention even when you walk close to them. Even cats in Marrakech are very loud and contributes to the noise of the city. Here is Mr. Cat trying to be forgiven by Mrs Cat for something, but without much success. </p>

 			<p>The most beautiful thing to see in Marrakech is in my opinion the Jarin Majorelle. It was the residence of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Majorelle">Jacques Majorelle</a>, a French orientalist painter who was seduced by Marrakech and deicded in 1923 to live here. It is full of exotic plants and very tall cactus. In the middle, there is the artist's studio in Art Deco style, painted in <span style="color: #6050dc; font-weight: bold">"Majorelle Blue"</span>. The contrast of green/blue color is very fashinating. It was then acquired by the French fashon designer Yves Saint Laurent in 1980. Closeby, the Yves Saint Laurent museum: if you are not particulary interested in fashon, you can just see it from the outside: it is the most expensive attraction of Marrakech, but really nothing to see apart from its clothes collection.</p>

 				<p>The Saadian Tombs is a complex of buildings hosting the tombs of the Saadian dynasty members. It is nice of course, but nothing spectacular. The best part is this room, which you can see for 20 seconds after a queue of 45 minutes. Reminds you something? <a target="_blank" href="./spain.html#nasridtarget">The Nasrid Palaces in the Alhambra</a>, of course! And here is my personal bottom line of this trip: instead of going to Marrakech, give the priority to Granada/Cordoba. Much easier to reach, cheaper, safer, more beaufitul in general (in talking about Marrakech, Morocco is another story which I cannot tell). Anyway, it is fair to say that I did stayed in a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/africa/morocco/marrakech/articles/best-riad-hotels-in-marrakech/" target="_blank">Riad of Marrakech</a>, which is an magical experience you should do if you come in this city.</p>
