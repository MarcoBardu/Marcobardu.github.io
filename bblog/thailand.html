		<h3> Last part of my gap-semester. What a better place to conclude than South-East Asia? There is a vast community of backpackers in these countries, and for good reasons: hot weather, very cheap, incredible accomodations and hostel in economies that rely a lot on tourism. It is very safe, people are friendly, food is good, beaches are fantastic... South East Asia is like a big amousement park. <br>
		Thailand, 70mln souls, was the only South East Asian country that remained independent throughout the colonial period. "Thai" means in fact "free/independent". It is a kingdom, but the formal power swang many time between the army, thorugh countless coups, and more democratic systems. Since the average cost for 1 night in a good hostel is 7&euro;, and I want to move around a lot, I did not voluneer this time. 1 month accomodation budget: 200&euro;. Amazing.</h3>

		<h1> BANGKOK </h1>
		<h2> More than 10% of Thai live in the capital Bangkok (8 mln). It is a very big, cahotic, polluted city. As many Asian megacities, is a concrete jungle, and after 4 days you really feel like escaping toward the less-strressful places that Thailand can offer. Bangkok is <em>not</em> a beautiful city: there are nice massive temples, but that's it for sightseeing. It is definetly more a city to live than to visit. There are a lot of party-hostel which turn wild in the night, all with a swimming pool to escape the terrile heat of Thailand. I was here in January, the coldest month of the year, and there were 33&deg;, added to a terrible huminidy and smog. It is impressive to see many people consuming so much: water is not drinkable form the sink, so just imagine the number of plastic bottle used every day. Food is literally everywhere, in every street in every hour. Many massive malls hosts every day millions of people, and they are full. The streets are blocked all day long by an exausting traffic jam. Here you can bring your climate-change hysteria to a superior level. <br> Btw, here is my best-of Bangkok: </h2>

 				<p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/mHGoz5R3yFkBt6L38" target="_blank">Wat Phra Kaew</a> is a huge complex of temples surrounded by walls in the old part of the city, nearby governemntal institutions and the Grand Palace of the King. The area was established in 1782 and it hosts more than 100 building among Buddist temples, pagodas and regency institutions. Here are the 3 spires of 3 sanctuaries dedicated to Buddah and containing Buddhist manuscripts, relics and holy objects. They are the tallest structures of the compound (buily in the 18-19 century by the kings of that time. All kings are called King Rama(n)), and you can see them from far outside the walls, rising up between the residencial flats and governmental building surrounding the aera. The architecture of the temples is very fascinatng: intense colors (mostly violet, shinning gold, white, red) of the walls and elaborated statues of gods and mythical beings surround the temples. The terinal edges of the roofs end with a prolonged horns which give in my opinion a devilish aspect to Bangkok religious architecture. </p>

 				<p>Jim Thompson was an American architect born in Delaware in 1906. He moved to Thailand as a miliray servant during World War II, but fortunately to him the war ended before he saw action. He end up falling in love with Thailand and moved here (similar story of <a href="./morocco.html#Majorelle" target="_blank">Majorelle</a>) with no relatives or children. Highly gifted as a designer and textile colorist, he contributed substantially to the Thai silk industry growth and export in the West. We make a lot of money with which he built this colonial-stile house in the heart of Bangkok, merging Western architectural style with materials and elements form Asia. He dismantled pieces of old traditional houses aorund Thailand and moved them to Bangkok to assembly his. The rooms are elevated from the ground to protect the house from floods, a practucal precaution of Thailand constructions. Jim suddenly disappeared in 1967 during a trip in Malaysia and was never found (this is the most likely scenario that should happen every day to me accoring to... guess...). His beautiful house remained a must-visit destination in Bangkok.</p>

 				<p>On the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/w84B9RnTZXob4YHeA" target="_blank">west side</a> of the Chao Phraya river, the main river dividing the capital, rises the Wat Arun, "Temples of Dawn". It is among the best known of Thailand's landmarks. Although the temple had existed since at least the XVII century, its distinctive spires were built in the early XIX century during the reign of King Rama II. To reach it, take a 4THB (12cents) ferry ride across the river. It is massive, 86 meters tall, and it is particulary beautiful looking it dring night when it is lit-up. The facade is decorate with porcelains mosaics. The central and the satellite spires (<em>Prangs</em>) syblolise Hindu cosmology elements and are devoted to the wind god Aruna. The entire structure is composed to different level terraces accessible through stone stairs. </p>

 				<p>46 meters long, 15 meters high, finished with plaster (aka strucco) and gilded leaf, it is an impressive statue of the Buddha laying down while he is passing into the Nirvana (you can see it form <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/th/video/clip-20057365-reclining-buddha-wat-pho-temple-bangkok-thailand" target="_blank">his face</a>). Nirvana is not Smell Like Teen Spirit, but is the Buddist state in which you reach the absence of pain, which is the ultimate goal of life (Schopenhauer is the first Westen philosofer introducing Oriental religion elements in his painful philosophy, it is related). It is the most interestig thing to see in Wat Pho, another complex of temples close to Wat Phra Kaew (temples in Thailand are like curches in the West, they are literally everywhere, but there are much more monks than priests). In the same complex, there is the <em>massage pavillon</em>, were you can enjoy a very good foot massage since is done by people who make <strong>just</strong> that as a profession. Foot massages after a long day walking is something that wow!! A must-do in Thailand (I know what are you thinking about, shame on you). </p>

 				<p>This is the most wonderful thing I saw in Bangkok. It is strange becase it is not very pubblicised in travel guides. We are in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ivb5p6v6gzke7i6b9" target="_blank">Wat Paknam</a>, another huge temple complex this time not in the citycenter. Enter a building that looks like the Wat Arun, climb 4 floors and you end up in a room where there is this marvelous emerald crystal tower (I dont know if it was crystal, glass or plasic). It is something different compared to what you usually see in Buddhist temples. From the pictures, it looked like something made on the computer, but once there, the expectations were met: the emerald tower is lit by sourrounding spotlight creating a emerald shade on the colourful ceiling, which has Buddhist cosmology concepts painted. The effect is really amazing, it looks like to see a 3d movie at the cinema. You do not really have a sense of perspective or depth while looking at that. 10/10! Outside the temple, they are building a 70meters high Buddha. I guess is gonna become a top-destination within few years. </p>

		<h1>CHIANG MAI </h1>
		<h2>The Northen Thiland is the ideal place to escape the heat, huminity and unrest of Bangkok. We are close to Myanmar, in a region dominated by beautiful landscapes, mountain and green river valleys. There is still a tropical climate, but in the night there is a big temperature excursion so that you can have a fresh sleep. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chiang+Mai,+Distretto+di+Mueang+Chiang+Mai,+Provincia+di+Chiang+Mai/@19.1198546,98.4059307,7.89z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x30da3a7e90bb6f5d:0x98d46270a59b4367!8m2!3d18.7952876!4d98.9620002" target="_blank">Chiang Mai</a> is the largest city and cultural capital of Nothren Thailand.

 				<p>The old part of the town in enclosed by a pefectly square wall and canals. Here is the place to stay if you are visiting Chiang Mai. There are marvellous temples in every corner, so be prepared to take off-and-on your shoes (flip-flops not allowed). Besides temples, there are very nice glass-walled coffee shops and little traditional restaurants in tree-lined shady streets. The athmosphere is very peaceful and relaxing in the secondary streets of the old town. The eastern part of the square was my favourite, and I took Ratvithi Rd as a reference for this area. Guest houses, western book-shops, colorful souvenir shops, street food stalls... all very nice. </p>

 			<div class="commento">
 				<p>One of Thailand and Asia emblem (come le banke per il capitalismo!1!!): <strong>street food</strong>. Here is a market that they do in Chiang Mai every Saturday night. It is very very crowded, and you find everything to eat. But you do not have to wait until Saturday to enjoy crowded street-food places. They are in every corner of every Asian city. They would probably be prohibited in Western Europe due to an arguable standard of hygiene. The deliciuos deep-fried smell of the food blends with gasoling/smog of the street. The stalls are often placed above sewer covers. Cats and dogs wandering around... And it is not rare so see big lovely rats running around. Just be open minded and do not think too much where the food comes from. But it is encouraging to see the amount of people eating in these places, so, as long as thousands of people do not get food-poisioned every day, you can give it a try. If you want to eat cheap and typical, street food is the thing (take into account at least one food-poison episode in your trip. So far I was lucky). </p>

 				<p>Organize with you hostel mates a day trip to one of the many natural attrations around the city. There are big-red-10 seats taxies ready to pick you up from the hostel and get you whereever you want for a very cheap price, to be further divided by 10. Half an hour from the old town, there is the Grand Canyon. It is not huge as you may think, but is very pretty. You can spend there half a day swimming in the lake, and for the most couragous, you can dive form high reefs. Just be careful, cause the safety measures are not so strong and some people even passed out in the past. Yeee! Since I prefer to go to the hospital for food-poisoning rather than broken bones, I just took a ride on the kayak.  </p>

 				<p>I did not go to the elephant rescue parks, which is a very typical thing to do in Chinag Mai. To make up for it, I went to the "Sticky Waterfalls". 1 hour from the Old Town, it was my favourite thing. They are called <em>sticky</em> cause you can walk down through the water without slipping on the stones. It is not difficult, and your feet will not hurt. So you make a nice and relaxing walk in the jungle via-waterfall. Oddly,there were not so many people, so it is quite peaceful and you can take nice dream-life pictures. A signal at the beginning of the way warns you of snakes (I did not see any). Bring your swimsuit and be careful your phone doesn't fall down. </p>

 				<p>I could not miss a Muay Thai match in Thailand! The famous Thai Boxe takes place in Bangkok, but there were matches to see even in Chiang Mai Boxing Stadium. I did Thai Boxe for 2 months 2 years ago, but it was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208183998465331&set=t.1462745677&type=3&theater">too delicate, light, elegant and graceful</a> for it. So being in the audience was better for me. The first half an hour was exciting, then you get used to the punches and kicks so you just tart to drink beer and eat popcorn, watching crazy Thai people betting hard on the match winner. </p>
